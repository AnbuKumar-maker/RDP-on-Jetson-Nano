Open the blacklist.conf file with vi:


sudo vi /etc/modeprobe.d/blacklist.conf
 

Scroll to the bottom of the file and press ‘o’ to insert a new line and edit. Add the following line:


blacklist rtl8192cu
 

Press ‘esc’ to exit insert mode, and type ‘:wq’ to write the file and exit. Sometimes, it can also help to disable power saving mode to the WiFi card:


sudo iw dev wlan0 set power_save off
 

You will want to get the IP address of your Nano, too (write this down, as you’ll need it for RDP and SSH):


ifconfig
 

Finally, install the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server. I know that RDP is a proprietary protocol by Microsoft, but it seems to work better than VNC on the Nano.


sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y xrdp
 

Follow this with a reboot:


sudo reboot
